# AMD Project
Repository for the project of the course "Algorithms for Massive Datasets".

The aim of this project is the implementation from scratch of a system to find frequent item-sets in a movie database.

In particular the chosen algorithm is the parallel version of SON algorithm applied with A-priori using SPARK.

The dataset used to perform this analysis is [letterboxd](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gsimonx37/letterboxd) (available on  Kaggle),
which is a collection of movies and tv shows obtained from the website [letterboxd.com](https://letterboxd.com).
